# Reactions
Reactions allow units to perform actions out of the normal activation sequence. Units may attempt a reaction to a few different possible triggers. A unit may only make a reaction if they have not yet taken any actions this round or if they are on Hold. When a unit reacts, it may perform a single action out of sequence. Once it does so, that unit may no longer perform any further actions this round and counts as activated.

## Reaction Triggers
Units may react to the following triggers:
* A unit is targeted by a Shoot action, Fight action or Charge action
* A unit on Hold has a unit move within range of a charge or shooting attack

## Making A Reaction
To make a Reaction, a unit declares they are attempting to react to one of the above triggers and takes an Initiative skill check. If failed, the unit takes 1 Shock and may activate later in the round. If passed, the unit may immediately perform one action after which it counts as activating for the round.

## Reaction Timing
Reactions follow some special timing as they interrupt another unit's activation. Attack actions such as Fight or Shoot are performed simultaneously with the interrupted unit's activation. This means if a unit reacts to a shoot action, it performs its own shoot action simultaneously with the unit targeting it. All other actions are performed before the interrupted unit's activation such as Move actions or Evade actions.
