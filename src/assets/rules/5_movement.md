# Movement
Each model in a unit making a Move action may move up to its movement characteristic in any direction. At the end of a unit's move, models in the unit must maintain a 2" coherency and may not be more than 6" away from any other model from the unit. Models may move through other friendly models so long as they do not end their movement on top of any friendly models. Models may not move within 1" of an enemy model unless charging that unit.
## Unit Facing
Units may end their movement in any orientation so long as this does not move the unit beyond its movement characteristic.
## Crossing Low Obstacles
Units crossing an obstacle that is 2" or less in height during their move must take an Initiative skill check. If failed, the unit loses 2" of Movement for that action. If passed, the unit may continue to move without penalty.
## Climbing Terrain
When climbing an obstacle, first measure its height. If a unit does not have enough movement speed to reach the top, it may not attempt to climb.
To climb an obstacle during their move must take an Initiative skill check. If failed, the unit halves its remaining movement. If passed, the unit may continue to move without penalty. If a unit no longer has enough movement distance after failing the test to climb the obstacle it may not do so.
## Leaping Across Gaps
Units may attempt to jump a gap which they have the movement distance to cross. To do this, take an Initiative test. If passed, the gap is successfully crossed. If failed, follow the rules for falling, and place the unit on the surface below the gap.
## Jumping or Falling Down
Jumping or falling units must take an Initiative test if they fall or jump down a height of more than 3". If failed, all models in the unit must take a Save roll. If passed, the unit hits the ground and may continue normally.
# Shooting
Shooting at the enemy is the surest way to get them to rout from the field. Models may come equipped with various weapons, but firing them is all very similar. In order to shoot at a target unit, its target must be within range of the weapon being used. Units may never shoot at enemy units that are engaged in melee with friendly units. This is simply too much risk to friendly units.

__For Example:__ My model is equipped with a Rifle that has 12"/24" range. The target must be at least inside the weapon's Long range band of 24" to shoot at it.
## Line of Sight (LOS)
Before shooting, make sure a model can "see" its target. Get down at eye level with a model if it is difficult to tell. If a modelâ€™s stance makes it difficult to see any targets, replace it with a different model with the same equipment and check its line of sight. Models where only 1/3 or less is visible do not count as being visible. With adequate cover and intervening terrain, it is okay to be generous here.
### LOS For Mounted Weapons
Each unit has 4 arcs, Front, Left, Right and Rear. These are relative to the front of the unit. Before the game, if there are any questions as to what is the front of a unit, players should agree and keep that consistent for the game. If a unit is in more than one arc, always choose the best arc for the shooter. Ranges and arcs are measured from the mounting point of the weapon on the unit or barrel of the weapon if it has one.
## Shooting Sequence
When a unit shoots, it may attack with all its equipped weapons. All instances of the same weapon must target the same unit. Any split fire must be declared before attacks are rolled.

__Impossible Shots:__ Units may declare shots that are impossible (units that may not be targeted etc). If during the attack rolls that unit becomes available to attack, those shots can then be resolved. If not, those shots are not made.

### Roll To Hit
For each weapon, roll a number of D10 equal to the number of attacks the weapon has. Any results that are equal to or less than the unit's Accuracy skill are successful "hits" and must be saved by the defender.

__Extra Hits:__ Abilities which grant extra hits (1 hit counts as 2 for example) do not benefit from other weapon abilities which trigger on the same value. They are simply one extra hit with the weapon's base profile. For example, I have an ability which grants extra hits on 2 or less and one where hit rolls of 2 or less gain +1 AP. The extra hits would not gain +1 AP.

#### Long Range
If a unit's target is outside a weapon's Short range band and in range of its Long range band it suffers -1 to its Accuracy rolls.
### Save Rolls
For each "hit" suffered, the defender must assign the hit to a model. Only models that were valid targets of that attack may be assigned hits (models out of line of sight or otherwise may not be hit by that attack). Abilities or special rules which allow a model to negate hits are applied after the hit is assigned. A unit may only use one such ability, so choose the best one.
For each hit, roll a D10 and subtract the AP value of the weapon from the target's Save characteristic. Each result that is equal to or less than the defender's Save is successfully stopped. Any remaining hits cause the target to lose 1 wound or be killed if the target has only 1 wound. Any models with zero wounds are then removed from the table as casualties.

__Automatic Failures:__ Save rolls of 10 always fail, as do any other skill checks on 10s. For the purposes of any abilities which measure the amount the Save was failed by, subtract the unit's Save value from 10. For example, I fail a Save roll on a 10 and my unit has Save 12. I have failed that Save by -2 and would use -2 for any rules which reference how much a Save was failed by.

#### Point Blank Range
If a shooting attack takes place at a range of 3" or less, models do not benefit from any cover bonuses (explained later in the terrain section).
