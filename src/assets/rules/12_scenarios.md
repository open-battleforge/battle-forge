# Scenarios
The following section describes all rules common to every scenario. For specific scenarios, visit the scenario tab of the game module you're playing or the scenario generator to generate a random scenario.

## Objectives
Players control objectives if they end the turn within 3" the most models on the objective. Models with Wounds(x) count as X models instead of just one model for objective control. Once controlled, control is maintained until it is later contested or captured by an enemy unit. If there are equal numbers of enemy and friendly units within 3" of an objective, both players lose control of the objective.

## Victory Points (VP)
Victory points are the primary way to win scenarios. Players score victory points as described in the scenario and the player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner.

## Scenario Length
All scenarios are complete at the end of game round 6. At that point, players add up the number of victory points they have scored and a winner is determined.

## Reserves and Transports
Before deployment, any units in reserve such as ambush, outflanking or other and units inside transports are set aside and not deployed during that phase. Players may choose any units to be left in reserves as long as that player has a reserves table edge marked in the scenario. When activating a unit in reserves, if it is not yet on the table (or does not arrive via a special rule), it may enter on a designated reinforcement edge. It must first perform a Move action from the table edge to arrive, but then may complete any action.

### Ambush
Any round after the first, when this unit is activated while in reserves, you may choose a point on the battlefield 12" away from any enemy units and take an Initiative check. If passed, place the unit at that location on the location. If failed, use D10 scattering to determine the landing location of the unit relative to the chosen point. If scattering would put the unit off the table, put the unit on the table edge as close as possible to the scatter location.

### Outflanking
Any round after the first, when this unit is activated, it may be set up within 6" of a table edge that is not in the enemy deployment zone, and more than 12" from any enemy units.

## Deployment
Players roll off to determine which deployment zone will be theirs. The player who wins the roll-off must place the first unit. Players then alternate placing units in their deployment zone until all have been placed.
