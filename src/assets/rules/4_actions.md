# Actions
All units may perform actions. Some actions are specific to the scenario being played and some are available on unit or model abilities.

## Available Actions
The following actions are available to all units.

### Focus
The unit gains a focus token which can be spent when it attacks for +1 Accuracy or Strength for that attack.
### Shoot
The unit attacks with all equipped Ranged weapons. Units may only shoot once per round.
### Fight
The unit fights will all equipped melee weapons in close combat. A unit may only fight once per round. If a unit has no Melee weapons, it may not perform Fight actions.
### Move
All models in the unit move up to their movement characteristic.
#### Rushing
When performing a move action, a unit may attempt to rush. The unit takes an Initiative skill check. If passed, the unit may move an additional number of inches equal to half its movement characteristic rounded down with that Move action. If failed, the unit takes a Shock at the end of the Move and does not gain any benefit. Units may never rush across obstacles or through difficult terrain.
### Charge
The unit declares a target and makes a move action into base contact with it and may make a free fight action. A unit may not charge if already in close combat. A unit may only use a Charge action if it is in range of an enemy unit it can reach with its move action.
### Hold
The unit prepares itself and may perform a reaction later in the round. It may automatically perform a reaction later in the round without testing Initative.
### Evade
The unit gains an Evade token which can be spent when it is targeted by an attack causing the attacker to suffer -1 Accuracy or -1 Strength for that attack.
### Rally
The unit attempts to regroup and prepare to fight on. Roll a Courage check for each Shock on the unit and any successes remove one Shock.
## Simultaneous Actions
Some rules may instruct players to perform actions simultaneously. What this means, is the currently active player will perform the action in its entirety without applying its effects, and then the target player will perform the action. After both players have had an opportunity to perform the action un-interrupted the effects are resolved such as removing models or apply status effects such as Shock.

__For Example:__ It is my activation and I am shooting at an enemy unit. That unit performs the Return Fire reaction (described later under reactions). I would resolve my shooting attack entirely and determine how many models are hit and killed (without removing the models from the target unit until they have had an opportunity to perform their shoot action). Then, my opponent would perform their shooting action and determine the number of models hit and killed in my unit. After we have both performed the action, we both remove any killed models and apply and effects such as Shock from the attack.
## Group Activations
Some units have the ability to perform group activations. This means that unit will activate with other units as a group and perform activations together. Units which can group activate will have a special rule permitting them to do so and that rule will specify how many other units may activate. When performing group activations, all units must perform the same actions together. The units perform all actions simultaneously. A unit may only be part of a group activation if it has not yet activated. Once any units are part of a group activation, they may not activate again later in the round.
