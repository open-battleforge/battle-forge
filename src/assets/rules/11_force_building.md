# Force Building
For a full game, the following force building restrictions apply. For casual or beginner games, feel free to simply pay the points for any units you wish to bring and ignore force building restrictions.
## Points Limit
Players should agree on a Points limit before constructing lists. This can be anywhere from 500-3000+ depending on game time requirements and model availability.
For standard games we recommend 1000 points.
## Under Points Limit
Players with lists totaling less than the agreed point limit have a better chance of winning the initiative. For each 5 points under the points limit a player is, that player earns one advantage point. When taking initative rolls or rolling for mission setup, the player with the most advantage points automatically wins any ties. If no player has any advantage points, scenarios continue as normal.
## Strategy Points
Strategy points are a way to add extra flavor by providing limited-used extra abilities. In addition, most game modules allow some dice to be re-rolled to smooth out some match-defining dice rolls.
### Gaining Strategy Points
Players gain strategy points at the beginning of each game round. This is your pool of strategy points available for the round which may be spent on a variety of game effects depending on the game setting. A player always gains at least 1 strategy point per round. Some abilities or effects may allow a player to gain additional strategy points. Only one strategy point per round may be gained per round by unit or faction abilities, even if multiple effects allow a player to gain strategy points. At the end of a round, players discard any remaining strategy points meaning they do not carry over from round to round.

### Strategy Point Counts
The amount of strategy points players gain per round is dependent on the game size and how many force organizations a player fills out. Players gain a base of 1 strategy points per round, and an additional 1 per 500 points played.

__For Example:__ We are playing a 1000 point game, so I would gain 1 base, and 1000/500 = 2 additional strategy points per round. If we are playing a 500 point game, we would get 1 base, and 500/500 = 1 additional strategy point per round.
### Spending Strategy Points
Each strategy will specify when it may be used. This can include when a unit is targeted by an attack, when a unit is activated, and many more. A unit may only be the target of one strategy per action it takes (Move, Shoot, Focus etc).

### Pre-game Strategies
Some strategies are used before the game begins. You may spend strategy points from your first-round strategy point income to activate these strategies. Note however, those points will be unavailable for the first game round.

## Legends
Legends are particularly memorable people or weapons. They typically replace or upgrade a unit with a unique ability which cannot be acquired elsewhere.

### Purchasing a Legend
Legends may be purchased using list building points and have a limit to how many may be taken. Typically they will replace an item or unit, or give a unit additional abilities. Players make take one legend per 1000 game points being played. For games under 1000 points, players may each simply take one legend. Each legend also may only be taken once in a list.

__For Example:__ We are playing a 2000 point game, and 2000/1000 = 2 allowed legends. If we are playing a 1000 point game, I am allowed to take 1 legend.

### Force Organizations
Game modules and sometimes game factions each specify restrictions on the number of each type of unit that can be used. First, choose a Force Organization and note down its Strategy Point cost (listed next to its name) in order to bring that organization. Stronger or sometimes larger forces may require spending more of your strategy points. The total number of strategy points paid for force organizations are subtracted from your strategy point income each round. A list may include any number of Force Organizations, so long as your strategy points do not go below zero.
### Allied Forces
Some game modules may group factions into allied groups. In this case, you may bring a separate Force Organization (paying its strategy point cost) to include an allied faction in your Force. Factions that are in the "Unaligned" category do not have allies and may not take allied detachments. Factions in the "Mercenaries" category may be allied to any faction.
## Force Focus
Focuses are limited or focused version of a specific faction with certain benefits representing a sub-faction of a standard faction. Any force can choose a focus to unlock additional list building opportunities.
### Focus Advantages
Choosing a focus typically unlocks specific strategies for that force, but may come with some trade-offs such as limiting the amount of units you can pick while allowing you access to more powerful versions of specific units. There is no cost for picking a focus other than these potential trade-offs.
