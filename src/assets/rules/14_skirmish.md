# Skirmish Rules
Skirmish scenarios are smaller scale engagements with more limited forces. This requires a few additional rules to make matches more interesting.
The following changes are modifications to the normal rules listed in the previous sections.

## Skirmish Points Limit
Players should agree on a Points limit before constructing lists. This can be anywhere from 100-300+ depending on game time requirements and model availability. For standard games we recommend 150 points.

## Skirmish Legends
Players make take one legend per 100 game points being played. For games under 100 points, players may each simply take one legend. Each legend also may only be taken once in a list.

For Example: We are playing a 200 point game, and 200/100 = 2 allowed legends. If we are playing a 100 point game, I am allowed to take 1 legend.

## Skirmish Strategy Points
The amount of strategy points players gain per round is dependent on the game size and how many force organizations a player fills out. Players gain a base of 1 strategy points per round, and an additional 1 per 50 points played.

For Example: We are playing a 150 point game, so we would gain 1 base, and 150/50 = 3 additional strategy points per round. If we are playing a 100 point game, we would get 1 base, and 100/50 = 2 additional strategy points per round.

## Models and Injuries
When a model would normally be killed, it may sometimes only be injured and not removed from combat. The following determines what happens to a model in that case.

### Injury Chart
When this model would be killed, roll a D10 adding the amount it failed the save by plus the number of critical damage tokens it has and refer to the following:

* Shaken(3+): Take one additional shock.
* Panic(6+): Take 2 additional shock and immediately take a Courage test. If failed the unit is destroyed.
* Destroyed(9+): It is instantly destroyed.
* Critical(12+): The unit is destroyed and all units within 6\" gain 2 Shock.

Mark each time the unit rolls on the chart with a critical damage token. While a unit has one or more damage tokens, it may not remove that amount of Shock.
