# Multiplayer Games
The following multiplayer rules are intended to allow players to play on "teams" against one another and to speed up game play while retaining the proper game balance.

## Free-for-all
Free-for-all games are played very similarly to one-on-one games in that each player bids to gain initiative. All players still bid and in order of the highest bid, take the highest bid and subtract the lowest bid. Each player may activate that many units in bidding order. If there are any ties players roll-off to determine who will go first.

__For Example:__ There are three players. Player one bids 5, player two bids 3 and player three bids 1. Player one will activate 5 - 1 = 4 units first. Then player two would then activate 3 - 1 = 2 units. Finally, player three would activate one unit. Play then continues in the same order with each player activating one unit until all units are activated.

## Team Games
When playing team games, both team-mates will add their bids together for the purposes of determining the first team to activate. Then, both totals are compared to determine the number of activations the highest bidding team can activate. Each player then individually assigns shock to their own units. When activating units, each player on the team will activate one unit, or in the case of imbalanced teams, the players on the smaller team together may activate a number of units equal to the larger team's size.

__For Example:__ There are two teams of two players each. Team one bids 5 and 3 making a total bid of 8. Team two bids 3 and 4 making a total bid of 7. Team one may activate one unit per player before their opponents.
