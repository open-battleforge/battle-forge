# Shock
When units are shot at or assaulted, they begin to get exhausted and may decide not to act at all. We represent this with Shock.

### Gaining Shock
Units gain a Shock when any of the following occur:
* A unit is hit by an attack
* A unit within 3" is destroyed

A unit may only inflict a maximum of one Shock on a target unit unless a special rule specifies otherwise.

### Effects of Shock
Shock causes units to perform worse and move less under pressure. For each shock a unit has, it suffers the following effects:
* -1 Accuracy
* -1 Strength
* -1 Movement
* -1 Initiative

### Removing Shock
When a unit is activated, before any actions are taken, take one Courage skill check for each Shock. For each passed test, remove one Shock.

## Break Tests
A unit must take a break test in any of the following situations:
* After a unit receives shock, if it has shock equal to or greater than its Courage value
* If a unit loses more than half its models or Wounds(x) in one attack

A break test is a single Courage skill check, and if failed, the unit breaks. The unit must move 6" away from the closest enemy unit, after which the unit performs an Evade action. If the unit cannot fall back 6" away from the closest enemy unit (in the case it is surrounded or otherwise, it surrenders and is immediately destroyed instead).
