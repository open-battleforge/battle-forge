# Terrain
Units in cover are much less susceptible to enemy fire and gain bonuses depending on their level of cover. 
Players should agree on terrain types and capacities before the game begins to avoid slowing the game down.
## Obstacles
An obstacle is any piece of terrain that is linear and may block movement such as a wall or hedge. Units only receive cover from an obstacle if the defending unit is within 2" of the obstacle and the majority of attacks from the attacking unit cross that obstacle.
__Low Obstacles:__ Some rules may reference low obstacles. A low obstacle is one that is 1" or less in height.
## Cover
Cover gives units certain modifiers depending on the type. Those can be any of the following and can be used in combination.
### Normal Cover
Units in normal cover gain +1 to their Save rolls. Ex. Walls, buildings, small fortifications
### Obscuring Cover
Units in obscuring cover cause the attacking unit to suffer -1 Accuracy. Ex. Forests, fog, large bushes
### Fortified Cover
Units in Fortified cover gain +2 to their Save rolls. Ex. Very heavy terrain such as bunkers
### Negative Cover
Units in negative cover suffer -1 to their Save rolls. Ex. in a moat
## Ground Types
Certain sections of the table may be designated to have different movement effects such as the ones below.
### Difficult Ground
Units performing a Move action that crosses difficult ground must take an Initative test. If failed, that unit lose 2" of movement for that action.
### Roads
Units that start and end a Move action on a road gain +2" of movement for that action.
## Enclosed Buildings
For the sake of simplicity and to avoid too many fiddly rules situations, units inside enclosed buildings are said to be occupying the entire floor of a building. There are no restrictions on what models can shoot out of a building based on what windows or doors may exist. Units inside buildings with fixed arcs must specify which side of the building they are facing in order to work out where the arc is coming from.
### Entering/Exiting
Units may enter a solid building’s first floor if all models in a unit end their move within 6” of it. They may leave the building or change floors of a building with a Movement action.
### Capacity
Players should decide on the model capacity of buildings before the game, but by default, they may hold 12 models per floor.
## Area Terrain
To represent terrain that covers an area rather than a specific location such as a forest, field of crops, or a ruined building, players may choose to play the terrain as "area terrain". Models whose bases overlap or are fully inside of area terrain are affected by the terrain instead of just those behind it.
### Line of Sight
Players should agree on whether area terrain can be seen through or just into (and out of). Terrain such as dense woods could potentially block line of sight except for units inside.
