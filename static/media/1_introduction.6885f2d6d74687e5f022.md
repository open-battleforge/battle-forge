# Introduction
Battle Forge is a set of modular wargame rules to use with your favorite miniatures or even some green plastic army men and is a great set of rules for beginners to wargaming. In our [Game Modules](/#/games) you can find the game modules we support. If you have an idea for a cool game setting, you can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/M9sets4) and let us know.

## Game Materials
To get started you'll need the following items:
* Two sets of miniatures (somewhere between 15-30 miniatures per side depending on the faction you choose) or something to represent your models (counters or tokens are fine)
* A tape measure or other measuring device with inches
* A set of D10 dice (about 10 or is ideal but you can theoretically play with just one)
* A table (or floor) to play on with optional terrain (books or other household items will do just fine)

## Skill Checks
When a unit is required to take a stat check, roll 1D10 and if the value is equal to or less than the stat, modified by any modifiers, the test is successful.

## Dice And Modifiers
Modifiers apply to the required result for the test being taken (+1 Accuracy on an Accuracy 4 model means a 5 is now required).
Rolls of 1 are automatically passed regardless of modifiers and rolls of 10 automatically fail.

## D10 Scattering
Some rules may refer to scattering using a D10. To do so, roll a D10 and follow the point on the D10 as well as the value to find the new landing location. If an attack scatters off the table, it simply misses. If a unit is arriving from reserves or is required to scatter for another reason and it scatters off the table, place it at the closest point on the table edge.
