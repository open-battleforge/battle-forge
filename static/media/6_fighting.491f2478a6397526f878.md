# Fighting
Fighting in close combat can be a deadly affair, but the most sure way to remove an enemy from a dug-in position.
## Who Can Fight
Models in base contact, or within 0.5" of a model that is in base contact with an enemy model may attack in Melee. Units may choose to split their attacks among any enemy units they are engaged with, provided the models are in range to attack that unit.

__Impossible Attacks:__ Units may declare attacks that are impossible (units that may not be targeted etc). If during the attack rolls that unit becomes available to attack, those attacks can then be resolved. If not, those attacks are not made.

## Attacking Sequence
Hit and Save rolls are identical to the shooting sequence, however units use any weapons designated with the "Melee" range in close combat and hit on their Strength skill instead of Accuracy.
#### Intervening Terrain
Units fighting across a piece of terrain suffer -1 to Strength rolls.
## Consolidate
After a unit has finished a Fight action, models in the unit may move up to 3" to close in with the enemy. This move must end closer to the closest enemy unit. The unit must not end its move out of coherency.
## Engaged In Combat
Units with models still in base contact remain locked in melee and may fight again in the next game round. In order to leave combat, the unit must fall back.

## Falling Back
Units wishing to fall back from melee with a Move action (or must do so after failing a break test) must pass an Initiative skill check to successfully retreat. If failed, all units engaged with that unit may make a free melee attack action against that unit. If the unit manages to escape with any models left, it may perform its move action normally.

# Morale and Shock
When units come under fire, their effectiveness decreases and they may even be forced to fall back.
