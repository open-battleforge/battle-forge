# Game Rounds
The following phases are done in order each round after which a new round begins.

## Bidding Phase
In the bidding phase, both players will secretly bid a number of Shock to try to gain the activation advantage. To do this, both players will choose a number of Shock they are willing to sustain this round. Then, both players simultaneously reveal their number and the player with the higher value may activate units equal to the difference in their values first. If there is a tie, both players roll off to determine the first activation and that player may activate one unit first.
For each Shock a player bids, they must assign a Shock to one of their units on the field, even if they lose the bid. 

### Shock Limit
Units must stay below half their Courage when assigning Shock. If all Shock cannot be assigned, assign as much as possible, and forfeit any activation bonuses. If both players fail to assign Shock, roll off to determine who gets first activation.

__Example:__ I bid 3 Shock, and my opponent bids 1 Shock. I must assign 3 Shock to my units and my opponent must assign 1. Now, I may activate 2 units before my opponent (3-1 = 2) because I bid the higher value. If I have a unit with Courage 6, I must stay below half that unit's courage of shock so I may only assign 2 to that unit.

## Actions Phase
Players alternate activating one unit and performing two actions with that unit, starting with the player that won the bidding phase. Play continues until both players have activated all units. When activated, a unit may choose two actions to complete as its activation. They may be done more than once unless otherwise specified.

__Unit Activations:__ A unit may only be activated a single time per round, regardless of any abilities which allow for free activations.

## End Phase
At the beginning of the end phase, both players will remove any leftover action tokens from their units including Focus and Evade tokens. Additionally, players will score any end-of-round VP for the current scenario and resolve abilities which occur at the end of the round.
